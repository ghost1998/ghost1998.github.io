    <div class="about">
        <div class="heading"> Who are we</div>
        We are an early stage EdTech startup utilizing maximum potential of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning to build actionable insights to re-imagine current teaching paradigms and learning systems.
        <br> <br>
        We are building a world class team blending passionate people who understand teaching and education, and sharpest minds in technology into one founding A-team to challenge age old unchanged way of learning.
        <br/> <br/>
        We have a singular vision of using technology and data to empower teachers, students & parents.

        <br><br>
        <div class="heading"> What are we building</div>
        Most of what we are building is meant to achieve two broad beliefs, :-<br>

        <ul>
          <li><b><font color = "black">Enhancing engagement as an Experience</font></b> : We are experimenting with a variety of innovative teaching methodologies using a data backed approach to create a next generation teaching platform.
            These inlcudes techniques like gamification, interactive videos, real time simulations, personalized and adaptive learning paths, building in-class technologies to improve both classroom and home learning experiences.
            This is led by people passionate for teaching as they understand process of human learning and evaluate the qualitative human coefficient keeping data in hindsight.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><b><font color = "black">Scalable Personalization</font></b> : Our data based learning platform analyzes and identifies studentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses which makes it
            easier for teachers and students to understand which areas to focus on to achieve their full potential. The analysis from the personalization platform tries to get a holistic understanding of a student
            helping both students and teachers to better understand and plan. Our personalized learning paths reduce pressure on students by better guiding them on how to understand concepts and crack exams.
            Our adaptive learning strategies try to improve the student's performance with maximum ease and comfort. Personalization is also aimed at delivering the content most interesting and engaging way possible.
             
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <b>Our unique teaching platform</b> and <b>personalization</b> not only
            provide students with a better learning experience but also help teachers by reducing the burden on them by providing them with content with our
            unique technology aided teaching methodologies which will save their time and efforts in designing the course material so that they can focus more on teaching,
            clearing doubts and understanding students. Thereby increasing personalized focus on students.

            <br/> <br/> 
        <div class="heading">How are we unique</div>
        What makes us truly unique is: Product cache, our beliefs and our founding team.
        <br><br>
        <div class="uniqueheaders">Product Cache</div>
        <br>
        We differentiate ourselves from the contemporary companies in the sheer amount of personalization we introduce and the unique interactive and engaging teaching formats we employ.
        <br><br>
        <div class="uniqueheaders">Perspective</div>
        <br>
        We believe in the right to information. We believe information should be free, open and should be accessible to every student. Information gives the student power to choose. It is one of our founding principles that we are not going to sell content. We want to keep the content open and free. We believe selling content will only create a conflict of interest when deciding what's the best possible path for a student. The model of selling content will eventually aim at getting students and schools to buy as many courses as possible instead of trying to focus on current courses and deliver the best possible paths for them.
        <br> <br>


        We believe in the idea that the traditional teaching is irreplaceable but also that it needs evolution.
        We believe teachers will always be needed for in-person learning and engagement, but in current education system, their full potential is not reached.  
        In order to take complete advantages that a traditional school systems can offer, we believe there are significant changes necessary in the current system. 
        The role of a teacher needs to focused and the teaching paradigms have to be improved. Our teaching platform reduces burden on them so that they can double down on teaching and focus on the student using personalized analysis. Using our platform, it will make the task of personalizing and accessing where a particular student is lagging behind, extremely easy. So we believe in this man+machine model to yearn the best learning experience for next generation.
