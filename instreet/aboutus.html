        <br/>
        We are an early stage Artificial Intelligence start-up aiming to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based actionable insights to enhance the current teaching and learning systems. 
        <br/> <br/>
        We have a singular vision of using technology and data to empower teachers, students and parents. 
        <br/> <br/>
        We are aiming to personalize learning and enhance engagement in teaching. We are using extensive statistical modelling for the former and innovating different innovative and data backed researched techniques for the latter. We employ techniques like gamification, interactive videos, real time simulations, personalized and adaptive learning paths, building in-class technologies to improve both classroom and home learning experiences. 
        <br/> <br/>
        Our data based learning platform analyzes and identifies studentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses which makes it easier for teachers and students to understand which areas to focus on to achieve their full potential. Our unique teaching platform not only provides students with a better learning experience but also helps teachers by reducing the burden on them by providing them with content with our unique teaching methodologies which will save their time and efforts in designing the course material so that they can focus more on teaching, clearing doubts and understanding students.
        <br/> <br/>
        We differentiate ourselves from the contemporary companies in the sheer amount of personalization we introduce and the unique interactive teaching formats we employ. Having come from an experience in diverse fields like financial modelling, Robotics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, we are using it to try to change the way learning and teaching is happening.
        <br/> <br/>
        We believe in the right to information. We believe information should be free, open and should be accessible to every student. Information gives the student power to choose. It is one of our founding principles that we are not going to sell content. We want to keep the content open and free. We believe selling content will only create a conflict of interest when deciding what's the best possible path for a student. The model of selling content will eventually aim at getting students and schools to buy as many courses as possible instead of trying to focus on current courses and deliver the best possible paths for them.
